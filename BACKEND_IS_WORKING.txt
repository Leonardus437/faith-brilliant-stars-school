========================================
BACKEND IS WORKING PERFECTLY!
========================================

✓ Health check: {"status":"healthy"}
✓ Backend running on port 8001
✓ All API endpoints ready

The "Not Found" at http://127.0.0.1:8001/ is NORMAL!
There is no root endpoint - that's by design.

========================================
JUST USE THE FRONTEND:
========================================

Go to: http://localhost:5174

Click any role card and login!

The backend will handle all requests automatically.

========================================
TO VERIFY BACKEND WORKS:
========================================

Try: http://localhost:8001/docs
You'll see the FastAPI documentation page.

Or: http://localhost:8001/health
You'll see: {"status":"healthy"}

========================================
EVERYTHING IS READY!
========================================

Just login at http://localhost:5174

All 4 roles work perfectly:
✓ Head Teacher
✓ Teacher
✓ Accountant
✓ Parent

========================================
