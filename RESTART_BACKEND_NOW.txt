⚠️ IMPORTANT: RESTART BACKEND NOW ⚠️

The backend code has been fixed to resolve the "No classes assigned" issue.

WHAT WAS FIXED:
- Fixed require_role() to properly compare UserRole enum values with string roles
- Updated attendance.py to pass string roles instead of enum objects

TO APPLY THE FIX:
1. Stop the backend server (Ctrl+C or close the terminal)
2. Restart using: python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
   OR
   Run START.bat or START_ENHANCED.bat

AFTER RESTART:
- Login as teacher@faithschool.rw / Teacher2024
- Go to /teacher/attendance
- You should now see 6 classes in the dropdown (P1 A through P6 A)

The issue was that the role checking was comparing enum objects incorrectly.
Now it properly extracts the enum value and compares it with the allowed roles.
